# Lecture Notes for Data Engineering in Spring 2015

## Lecture 1

STORM FRAMEWORK (TWITTER)


*SOCIAL NETWORKS
*DATA ANALYTICS
SAMPLING: NARROWING DOWN LARGE DATA SETS TO RELEVANT REASONABLE SETS THAT COULD BE ANALYZED TO ANSWER SUPPORT A HYPOTHEISIS OR  ANSWER A RESEARCH QUESTIONS
BIG DATA IS NOT ALWAYS ABOUT SAMPLING CAUSE WE CAN COMPUTE EVERY THING WITH THE POWER OF COMPUTING 
*STORAGE: NOSQL (PROBLEMS WITH DATA SCHEMA CHANGES IN SQL) NOT FLEXIBLE
          NOSQL ARE NOT GOOD WITH ARBITRARY QUERIES
          NOSQL: DOCUMENT, GRAPH, KEY-VALUE STORES,COLUMNAR
*DATA MODELING IS WICKED HARD :) PROBLEM WITH BIG DATA SITUATION E.G. STRUCTURE OF DATA CHANGES BECAUSE THE CURRENT DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION (SOLUTION MIGRATION EXPENSIVE BUT DOABLE)
*DATA COLLECTION + CLEANING (COVERED MORE IN OTHER COURSE) WHAT IS IN CLEANING: IT IS IN THE FORMAT I NEED? NORMALIZATION?

MORE ABOUT TWITTER:
SOME TWITTER CLIENTS SEND TWEETS THAT ARE NOT UTF-8 EVEN THOUGH IT TAGS THEM AS UTF-8 WHEN WE USE JSONS PARSERS WE GET TWEETS THAT HAVE MESSY ENCODINGS

*INFOVIZ:
D3 jscript framework for visualization on the browser
TABLOAR
EXCEL

THE DATA LIFE CYCLE:

WHAT IGNITES THE LIFE CYCLE IS A QUESTION --> CURATION/TRIAGE (FINDING THE RIGHT SOURCE NARROWING DOWN AKA CURATION/TRIAGE)
COLLECTION/GENERATION --> CLEANUP --> STORAGE --> PROCESSING/ANALYSIS --> QUERY/VISUALIZE/ACT

THE CYCLE REPEAT (ITERATIVE): AS THE LAST PHASE TRIGGERS NEW QUESTIONS WHICH TAKES TO PHASE 1
